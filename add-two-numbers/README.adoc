# Add Two Numbers Leet Code Problem

## Question

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Examples:
|===
| Equation | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output

| 0 + 0 = 0 | (0) | (0) | (0)
| 1 + 1 = 2 | (1) | (1) | (1)
| 1 + 9 = 10 | (1) | (9) | (0) -> (1)
| 10 + 1 = 11 | (0) -> (1) | (1) | (1) -> (1)
| 1 + 10 = 11 | (1) | (0) -> (1) | (1) -> (1)
| 342 + 465 = 807 | (2)->(4)->(3) | (5)->(6)->(4) | (7)->(0)->(8)
| 123 + 456 = 579 | (3)->(2)->(1) | (6)->(5)->(4) | (9)->(7)->(5)
